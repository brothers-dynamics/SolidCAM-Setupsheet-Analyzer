# Tool Usage Calculator

This web application allows you to analyze SolidCAM setup sheet files in HTML format. By uploading the datasheets, you can get a better understanding of the project, including estimations of the tool costs and the number of tools required. The application provides sorting capabilities to arrange the data based on your preferences.

## Usage

1. Serve the web application to run it locally. It is not recommended to open the `index.html` file directly in a browser.
2. Upload the SolidCAM setup sheet files in HTML format using the "Upload Datasheets" button.
